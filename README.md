A practice program made to take a user-defined initial conditon for an ODE and solve it. 1D Kalman filter will be applied to the result to predict the next 15 
iterations of the independent variable with uncertainty values.

The idea is that we've identified our system dynamics for a moving particle; our model has a bit of uncertainty, so a kalman filter is implemented to predict the position after 15 seconds.
